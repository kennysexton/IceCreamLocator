    <h3>Homework 1 - Data Model</h3>

    <p>I learned how to design a scheme in this assignment.  
        My work can be seen <a href="../labs/HW1.docx" download>here.</a>

    <h3>Homework 2 - Database</h3>

    <p>This one was a little tricky.  I had some trouble making the foreign keys.
        My submission can be seen <a href="../labs/HW2.docx" download>here</a>.  My schema has changed since then since I made some mistakes,
        and did not know that my web_user table should be the same as the example.</p>

    <h3>Homework 3 - Home Page</h3>

    <p>I have designed some small websites and projects
        before using html, css, and java script.  
    </p>

    <p>I used percentage based widths so that the page would dynamically change based on
        the size of the display screen.</p>

    <p>I learned about HTML and CSS code reuse in this lab, as well as how to set up a database with primary and forign keys.

    <h3>Homework 4 - Display Data</h3>

    <h4>Data Model</h4>

    <p>My data model is made up of four tables.  Web_users, user_role, supply, and flavor.
        The supply table links web_users with the flavors they carry.  You can view the data model

    </p>

    <h4>Display Data</h4>
    <p>
        Here are some <a href="../labs/HW4.docx" download>common errors</a> to watch out for.  This lab was pretty tough.  There was a lot to keep track of.
    </p>

    <h3>Homework 5 - Log on</h3>

    <p>
        This was a pretty tough assignment.  The last lab helped a lot.  I had the hardest time I had by far was with the session variables
        I added a method to the view package instead of making a search.java.  This meant that I had to make my session variable a bit different.
    </p>
    
       <h3>Homework 6 - Insert</h3>

    <p>
        Another assignment that was tricky.  I had trouble with making the register button work without first calling userCRUD.js. 
        Another strange issue I had was that my flavor_color value that I specified as a string would still trigger the date validation. 
        I think this has something to do with the order that arguments are stored in the JSON object.
    </p>

       <h3>Homework 7 - Delete</h3>

    <p>
        This assignment was pretty strait forward.  Once you figured out how to do the delete from webuser,  you just had to repeat the steps 
        you took to implement in delete and do it again for other and assoc.

        <h3>Tutorial</h3>
        <h4><a href="tutorial/proposal.pdf">Proposal</a>,  <a href="tutorial/writeup.html">Writeup</a></h4>

    <p>
        I decided to improve the menu used on this project.  I improve both the web version as well as added a mobile friendly menu that has an
        on screen transition.  I enjoyed getting to work more using CSS, it's always fun to add a personal touch to a project.  However, CSS can
         be very difficult at times.  For this project learned to really use the Chrome element inspector a lot to figure out styling issues.
