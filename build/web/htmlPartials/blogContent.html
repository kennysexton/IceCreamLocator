<h3>Homework 1 - Data Model</h3>

<p>I learned how to design a scheme in this assignment.  
    My work can be seen <a href="../labs/HW1.docx" download>here.</a>

<h3>Homework 2 - Database</h3>

<p>This one was a little tricky.  I had some trouble making the foreign keys.
    My submission can be seen <a href="../labs/HW2.docx" download>here</a>.  My schema has changed since then since I made some mistakes,
    and did not know that my web_user table should be the same as the example.</p>

<h3>Homework 3 - Home Page</h3>

<p>I have designed some small websites and projects
    before using html, css, and java script.  
</p>

<p>I used percentage based widths so that the page would dynamically change based on
    the size of the display screen.</p>

<p>I learned about HTML and CSS code reuse in this lab, as well as how to set up a database with primary and forign keys.

<p>My data model is made up of four tables.  Web_users, user_role, supply, and flavor.
