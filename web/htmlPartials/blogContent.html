    <h3>Homework 1 - Data Model</h3>

    <p>I learned how to design a scheme in this assignment.  
        My work can be seen <a href="../labs/HW1.docx" download>here.</a>

    <h3>Homework 2 - Database</h3>

    <p>This one was a little tricky.  I had some trouble making the foreign keys.
        My submission can be seen <a href="../labs/HW2.docx" download>here</a>.  My schema has changed since then since I made some mistakes,
        and did not know that my web_user table should be the same as the example.</p>

    <h3>Homework 3 - Home Page</h3>

    <p>I have designed some small websites and projects
        before using html, css, and java script.  
    </p>

    <p>I used percentage based widths so that the page would dynamically change based on
        the size of the display screen.</p>

    <p>I learned about HTML and CSS code reuse in this lab, as well as how to set up a database with primary and forign keys.

    <h3>Homework 4 - Display Data</h3>

    <h4>Data Model</h4>

    <p>My data model is made up of four tables.  Web_users, user_role, supply, and flavor.
        The supply table links web_users with the flavors they carry.  You can view the data model 
        <a href="labs/dataModel.JPG">here!</a>
    </p>

    <h4>Display Data</h4>
    <p>
        Here are some <a href="../labs/HW4.docx" download>common errors</a> to watch out for.  This lab was pretty tough.  There was a lot to keep track of.
    </p>

    <h3>Homework 5 - Log on</h3>

    <p>
        This was a pretty tough assignment.  The last lab helped a lot.  I had the hardest time I had by far was with the session variables
        I added a method to the view package instead of making a search.java.  This meant that I had to make my session variable a bit different.
